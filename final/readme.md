  Find top 10 petition employers in 5 years and the application trend of the top 5 employers
  
  Method: Mathplotlib and dataframe groupby
  
  Output: The bar plot of the top 10 petition employers and application trend.
  
  
Analysis 2: 

  Find the top 10 application states and jobs and top 10 jobs in each state
  
  Method: Split the worksite column into city and state

Analysis 3:

  H1B petition status pie plot and certification rate in each state
  
  Method: pie plot in matplotlib.pyplot
  
  Output: petition status with pie plot and certification rate with csv
  
Analysis 4:

  Application prevailing wage distribution in a company and average wage in each state
  
  Method: numpy.mean and seaborn
  
  Output: Prevailing wage distribution with distplot and average wage with bar plot
  
Analysis 5:

  Find the applications related to software and display on US map
  
  Method: Basemap
  
  Output: Display the application related to software on the us map
  
  Attention!: The basemap library need to be download and config. It is too big to upload. The instruction is this : https://peak5390.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/matplotlib-basemap-tutorial-installing-matplotlib-and-basemap/
